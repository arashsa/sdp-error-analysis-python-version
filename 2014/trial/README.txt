SemEval 2014 Task 8: Broad-Coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing: Trial Data

Version 1.1; November 24, 2013


Overview
========

This directory contains three files, each providing semantic dependency graphs
for a trial set of 187 sentences, taken from the first 20 documents in Section 
00 of the PTB WSJ Corpus.  The files instantiate the tab-separated format for
the description of general directed graphs, as documented on-line:

File names are comprised of an acronym denoting the specific annotation type,
and the common suffix ‘.sdp’ (which we will use on all data for this task).


Known Errors
============

None, for the time being.
