5. System specs

Our system is a three staged system of supervised classifiers. The first stage is for identifying the argument-predicate pairs in the sentence and the second stage for assigning them semantic roles, as well as pruning unnecessary pairs. Finally, the third stage predicts top nodes.
The main features used in prediction predominantly come from the dependency trees, POS tags and the surrounding sentence, but also features derived from additional data are used.
We use Liblinear for binary classification of argument-predicate pairs, SVM multiclass for multiclass classification of argument roles and Leveldb for fast access into preprocessed feature values.
We don't perform any significant pre- or post-processing for the data. As an additional data for this task we use Google syntactic ngrams dataset and pretrained Google News vector space model.
