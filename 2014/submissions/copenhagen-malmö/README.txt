Inventory of results files included in the archive:
Two closed system runs (closed.{dm,pas,pcedt}.{1,2}.sdp).

System characteristics, including (if applicable):
Our two approaches are based on novel tree approximation algorithms. The first run uses a pruning algorithm, leading to high precision on development data, while the second run uses a (more bijective) packing algorithm leading to higher recall. We did not pre- or post process the data in any way, used no external tools and no external resources.
