System characteristics:
    |--Core approach: Model combination
    |--Important features: Two kinds of parsers are combined. One kind is our own 
    transition-based dependency graph parsers, each with different transition 
    systems, the other kind is tree approximation algorithms plus mate-tools.
    |--Critical tools: mate-tools (we used the denpendency tree parser of it)
    |--Data pre- or post- processing: none
    |--Additional data used: none
